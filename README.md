# SubReddit

Steps
1. git clone https://github.com/NitinSatpal/subReddit.git
2. npm install
3. node checkSubReddit.js worldnews true

First argument is the name whose availability we are checking, second argument tells, in case the name is not available or is already been taken, then whether to fetch the urls of that already taken name or not.


Thanks.
